## The purpose of this repository is to deploy a PyTorch neural network and various other machine learning models on the UCI Adult dataset which can be found at in repository at UCI_Adult_Data.csv.

### The neural network can be found at UCI_NN.py and the machine learning algorithms can be found at UCI_ML.py

### After some preprocessing to make the dataset more general, I find a random forest classifer works best, while there is not much difference in performance between the neural network with only linear layers and that of a neural network with a variety of non-linear layers

### This project is incomplete

# UCI Adult Prediction with Pytorch and sklearn

Hi there! Thank you for checking out my repository!

## Overview

This repository contains code for deploying a PyTorch neural network in the UCI_Adult_PyTorch.py file
along with various machine learning algorithms in UCI_Adult_sklearn.py on the UCI Adult dataset
which can be found at UCI_Adult_Data.csv.
