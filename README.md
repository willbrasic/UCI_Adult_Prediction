## The purpose of this repository is to deploy a PyTorch neural network and various other machine learning models on the UCI Adult dataset which can be found at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/2/adult

### The neural network can be found at UCI_NN.py and the machine learning algorithms can be found at UCI_ML.py

### After some preprocessing to make the dataset more general, I find a random forest classifer works best, while there is not much difference in performance between the neural network with only linear layers and that of a neural network with a variety of non-linear layers

### This project is incomplete
