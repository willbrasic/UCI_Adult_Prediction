# UCI Adult Prediction with Pytorch and sklearn

Hi there! Thank you for checking out my repository!

## Overview

This repository contains code for deploying a PyTorch neural network in the UCI_Adult_PyTorch.py file
along with various machine learning algorithms in UCI_Adult_sklearn.py on the UCI Adult dataset
which can be found at UCI_Adult_Data.csv.
